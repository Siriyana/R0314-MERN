# CAT DATABASE APPLICATION - FRONTEND

This project is a web application for managing a cat house database. It provides an interactive interface for users to:
    -Fetch cats from the database
    -Search for cats by name or ID
    -Add new cats
    -Update cat details
    -Delete cats from the database

The application uses React for the front-end and communicates with a back-end REST API to store and manage cat data in a database.

# Technologies

-REACT for building user interface and managing forms
-JavaScript to code 
-Axios for making HTTP requests
